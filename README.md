# Exire Mobile

This is the React Native product for iOS/Android. It was our first experience both using React/React Native so it is full of antipatterns like prop-drilling and poor state management.

## Running

All of the API keys have been disabled so the application won't run unless you fill those variables. If you setup these variables, you can run with:

```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

## Mockups

The mockups for this app are available [on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/r2YdZovkTKbiithCsCPyzT/EXIRE?node-id=553%3A1063).
